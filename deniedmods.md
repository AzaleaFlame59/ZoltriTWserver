## Can I submit a mod suggestion?

That depends. If you can answer ALL the below questions with a BIG YES, then sure, go ahead.

1. IS YOUR MOD AVAILABLE FOR 1.7.10?
2. Do you have a link? (preferrably curseforge)
3. Does it fit with the ZoltriTW theme (i.e., Magic not Tech?)
4. Does it add anything meaningful?
5. Is it balanced?
6. Is it something known to cause performance issues on servers?
7. DID YOU SEARCH THROUGH THIS LIST AND MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED???

For other suggestions: answer whichever questions are applicable (i.e., everything except 1)
