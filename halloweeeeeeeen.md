# HALLOWEEEEEEEEEEEN

You are a team of detectives that has been invited to the town of (I DONT FUCKING KNOW) Spookville (Caleb named it) to investigate the MURDER of the Blacksmith, a lonely man with no family to speak of. The Mayor has asked that you deduce
- the Murderer :clown:
- the murder weapon :knife:
- the motive :eyes:
- where the body is :skull:
- and if there was an accomplice (and who it is) :smiling_imp: 

## Rules  
1. Whoever makes the correct accusation quickest is the winning team (prizes!)
2. Every INCORRECT accusation adds 5 minutes to your time!
3. You may only make an accusation in FULL (all elements of accusation listed above) to be told if it is correct or not.

There will be a prize just for participating. You won't need your equipment or items, and if you care about them you probably shouldn't bring them. All clues are within the town walls.

Basically, you'll be released into a small town with suspicious things in it and you need to gather all the info you can from the suspicious things to make a guess.
