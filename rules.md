:straight_ruler: Please read these rules carefully, and check back often to see if they've changed: :straight_ruler: 
1. Be respectful to everyone, not just mods/owners. This also means USING PEOPLE'S PREFFERED PRONOUNS! Check tablist or roles on Discord.
2. No griefing! Protect yourself from griefing! It is your responsibility to maintain the upkeep of your base. See more about this below.
3. No use of third-party software.
4. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. If something is clearly not meant to happen, report it! Don't exploit it. This will operate on a Warning-Tempban-Permaban basis (not necessarily for the same bug).
5. We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind. This includes slurs. PLEASE LOOK UP WHAT SLURS ARE, YOU *WILL* BE AUTOBANNED!
6. You must be the race you ally with (see rule 4). Alliance changes are expensive, but are offered in-store at spawn.
7. This is a mature server! Underage players will be banned.
8. No PvP logging! Don't be a coward.
9. You may only force-tp (Witchery rite or otherwise) someone onto UNCLAIMED LAND! We have ways of tracking this! It is up to the DEFENDER to bring it to our attention.
10. Do not make someone's game unplayable! (see below)

:video_game: UNPLAYABLE :video_game:   
What this is:
```
I can't go to my base.
I'm a newcomer and I've been cursed with waking nightmare.
I get disconnected/lag from what they did near/in my base.
They are killing me/tping me over and over for longer than 10 minutes.
```

What this isn't:
```
I don't feel safe while they are online.
They make me mad by talking in chat (/ignore!)
They keep cursing me with something that doesn't kill me.
They stole my hard-to-make gear through legitimate means and now I have to start again.
```

:bookmark_tabs: Greifing :bookmark_tabs:  
Griefing WILL NOT be acted upon (rolled back/refunded) or investigated if the window in which it occurred is more than 7 days not inclusive (that means >7 days not >=7 days).

As always, if you have ANY questions, feel free to PM me! And please do so BEFORE doing something questionable, not after.
