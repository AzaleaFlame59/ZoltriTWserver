:straight_ruler: Please read these rules carefully, and check back often to see if they've changed: :straight_ruler: 
1. Be respectful to everyone, not just mods/owners. Trash talk is okay but know where the line is. This also applies to Discord.
2. No griefing! Protect yourself from griefing! It is your responsibility to maintain the upkeep of your base. See more about this below.
3. No use of third-party software.
4. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. If something is clearly not meant to happen, report it! Don't exploit it. This will operate on a Warning-Tempban-Permaban basis (not necessarily for the same bug).
5. We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind. No leeway. This includes slurs.
6. You must be the race you ally with (see rule 4). Alliance changes are expensive, but are offered in-store at spawn.
7. This is a mature server! Underage players will be banned.
8. No PvP logging! Don't be a coward.
9. You may only force-tp (Witchery rite or otherwise) someone onto UNCLAIMED LAND! We have ways of tracking this! It is up to the DEFENDER to bring it to our attention.
10. Do not make someone's game unplayable! (see below)

:shield: DEFENDER: :shield:   
- If you are summoned by someone else (force-tp) you are the defender.
- There is no defender in PvP outside of claims (or summoning)!  
- There is no defender in Arena PvP.  

:video_game: UNPLAYABLE :video_game:   
What this is:
```
I can't go to my base.
I'm a newcomer and I've been cursed with waking nightmare.
I get disconnected/lag from what they did near/in my base.
They are killing me/tping me over and over for longer than 10 minutes.
```

What this isn't:
```
I don't feel safe while they are online.
They make me mad by talking in chat (/ignore!)
They keep cursing me with something that doesn't kill me.
They stole my hard-to-make gear through legitimate means and now I have to start again.
```
When in doubt, send me a note BEFORE you do it!!!

:bookmark_tabs: Greifing :bookmark_tabs:  
We play on a modded server, so preventing all forms of grief is impossible. I have instead opted to *log* what happens on claims. I log the use of certain items and entry into claims you aren't trusted on, and a few others. However, if you were offline for 14 days, and 30 people walked into your claim and used wands/other stuff, it is nearly impossible for me to figure out who did it. In addition, these logs get lengthy, even thought there's just 1 line of text per event. Because of these reasons, griefing WILL NOT be acted upon (rolled back/refunded) or investigated if the window in which it occurred is more than 7 days not inclusive (that means >7 days not >=7 days). It sucks, but I can't spend hours of my time looking through 16k lines of text.

As always, if you have ANY questions, feel free to PM me! And please do so BEFORE doing something questionable, not after.
