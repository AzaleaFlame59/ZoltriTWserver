:straight_ruler: Please read these rules carefully, and check back often to see if they've changed: :straight_ruler: 
1. Be respectful to everyone, not just mods/owners. Trash talk is okay but know where the line is. This also applies to Discord.
2. No griefing! In addition, do not abuse your claim powers! They can and will be taken away, leaving your stuff unprotected!
3. No use of third-party software.
4.  Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. If something is clearly not meant to happen, report it! Don't exploit it. This will operate on a Warning-Tempban-Permaban basis (not necessarily for the same bug).
5. We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind. No leeway. This includes slurs.
6. You must be the race you ally with (see rule 4). Alliance changes are expensive, but are offered in-store at spawn.
7. This is a mature server!
8. No PvP logging! Don't be a coward.
9. Botania sparks, floating flowers, and mana pools are each an entity, and some people's bases have over 100. You may NOT force chunkload the chunk with all the sparks in it. Please respect that I cannot afford to continue to upgrade the ram for this purpose.
