## Rules and Important Info

:straight_ruler: Please read these rules carefully, and check back often to see if they've changed: :straight_ruler:  
> NOTE: I reserve the right to punish rulebreakers AS I SEE FIT. If you have a problem with that, maybe don't play on a public server?

1. You must be respectful to everyone, including USING PEOPLE'S PREFFERED PRONOUNS! Check tablist or roles on Discord.
2. No griefing! See below for enforcement rules.
3. No use of third-party software.
4. If something is clearly not meant to happen, report it! Don't exploit it.
5. No discrimination of any kind. This includes slurs. PLEASE LOOK UP WHAT SLURS ARE, YOU *WILL* BE AUTOBANNED!
6. You must be the race you ally with. You must set your pronouns.
8. You must be over 15.
9. No PvP logging.
10. You may only force-tp (Witchery rite or otherwise) someone onto UNCLAIMED LAND!

:video_game: UNPLAYABLE :video_game:   
What this is:
```
I can't go to my base, but I also can't fix whatever is stopping me from going there.
I'm a newcomer and I've been cursed with waking nightmare.
I get disconnected/lag from what they did near/in my base.
They are killing me/tping me over and over for longer than 10 minutes.
```

What this isn't:
```
I don't feel safe while they are online.
They make me mad by talking in chat (/ignore!)
They keep cursing me with something that doesn't kill me.
They stole my hard-to-make gear through legitimate means and now I have to start again.
```

:headphones: Discord rules: :headphones: 
1. Your nick must have some indication of who you are in-game
2. If you don't have your correct role, put your name and chosen role in #i-need-a-role 
3. Other discord server links are OK as long as they're not for other minecraft servers

:bookmark_tabs: Greifing :bookmark_tabs:  
Griefing WILL NOT be acted upon (rolled back/refunded) or investigated if the window in which it occurred is more than 7 days not inclusive (that means >7 days not >=7 days).

As always, if you have ANY questions, feel free to PM me! And please do so BEFORE doing something questionable, not after.
