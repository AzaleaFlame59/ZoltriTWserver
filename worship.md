# Worship by Kali:
head to the god hall to view the gods, but you must be converted (tpa'd) by a follower.  

## :poop: commands :poop:  
- /ws check - check your own or another player's stats.
- /ws list - check your religion's members.
- /ws sacrifice - check your god's desired sacrificial item (if applicable).
- /ws holylands - teleport to your god's holylands.
- /ws validate - Re-add yourself to /ws list and appropriate roles.
- /ws help pp - see commands for PRIEST or HIGHER.
- It changes often, so use /worship or /ws help often to see whats up

## :smile_cat: to make your god happy: :smile_cat:  
- worship (plain right click, once an hour)
- eating the chosen food (changes weekly, dont eat old holy foods!)
- drinking from chosen villagers (vamps, hold a glass bottle in your first hotbar slot to drink for your god)
- when your god asks for it, sacrifice as many of what they ask for in 15 minutes!
- harvest mature chosen crops in the holy lands
- invite more players to join your god

## :pouting_cat: to make your god mad: :pouting_cat: 
- eat unholy foods
- harm villagers if theyre not into that
- ignore them
- leave them for another god/abandon all faith

## :smirk_cat: you: :smirk_cat: 
- piety = your score within that god
- more piety, better chance of getting blessed
- above a certain threshold and you are promoted to priest
- out of the priests, a prophet is chosen, who writes the holy scripture, interprets the god's wishes (holy foods, holy items, unholy items)

## :scream_cat: blessings/cursing: :scream_cat: 
your god will bless or curse you depending on their mood! with increasing potency! they might even steal ur stuff or KILL you!

### To Come
- piety decays to a certain point, kicked out of religion
- sacrificing players
- sacrificing mobs
- marriage
- customizing sacrifice liquid (currently only lava)
- customizing worship sound (currently VILLAGER_YES)
- put more suggestions in #suggestions
