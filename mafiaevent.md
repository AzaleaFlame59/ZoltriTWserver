# rules
the game starts. players must register with /mafia register
all the roles are randomly chosen. the rest of the players are villagers.

murderer - your goal is to kill all the villagers without them figuring out who you are    
doctor - every night you pick a person to "heal." if its the same person the murderer tries to kill, you save them from dying.  
detective - every night you pick a person to investigate. you /msg the GM a person and you learn their role  
jester - you want to get killed. you must act as suspiciously as possible so people think you are the murderer.  
escort - gets to distract one player per night from their action. if you try to distract the murderer, you die instead.  
arsonist - marks 1 player per night with gasoline. you can kill yourself to take your victims with you,  but if you are hung or murderered your victims survive.  
vigilante - gets to kill 1 person per night, if they are innocent you kill yourself.  

night falls. players with roles act with /mafia act <player>. the jester does not have an action at night.
  
when it becomes day, it is revealed who died the night before. the players then discuss who they will kill in the hopes of killing the murderer. present your theories here. once the vote is open, you vote for who you think is the murderer with /mafia vote <player>. the vote closes, and the person who got the most votes is killed by the town, and their role revealed. if it is the murderer, the villagers win! if not, another night passes and the cycle begins anew. 

The goal of the murderer is to kill everyone, and the goal of the villagers is to kill the murderer

## prizes:
- each game you participate in grants you 1 token (remember tokens?)
- if youre the murderer and you win, you get 5 tokens
- at the end of the weekend, you can exchange your tokens into different tier prizes
- the contents of the prizes will be randomly selected

for example,
- tier 1 may have 5 diamonds, some golems, a boss egg
- tier 2 may have a minor boss drop (ie not prim pearl or nether star), a spawner, a node
- tier 3 may have prim pearl, nether star, ichor, warp removal
you spend your tokens on each tier and are given a random item out of it
the token to tier ratio might change depending on how many games we run
like if we only run 6 games then tokens' value changes
