temporary file

the game starts. players must register with /mafia register
a murderer is randomly chosen from the registered player once registration is closed. a doctor and a detective are handpicked by the GM (dependent on how many players). the rest of the players are villagers.

night falls. the murderer must choose a victim. they /msg the GM who they would like to kill. the doctor also messages the DM, but they message who they would like to save. If the doctor and the murderer pick the same person, that person is saved from being murdered. the detective gets to pick someone at random and learn their role.

when it becomes day, it is revealed who died the night before. the players then discuss who they will kill in the hopes of killing the murderer. present your theories here. once the vote is open, you vote for who you think is the murderer with /mafia vote <player>. the vote closes, and the person who got the most votes is killed by the town, and their role revealed. if it is the murderer, the villagers win! if not, another night passes and the cycle begins anew. 

The goal of the murderer is to kill everyone, and the goal of the villagers is to kill the murderer

prizes:
- each game you participate in grants you 1 token (remember tokens?)
- if youre the murderer and you win, you get 5 tokens
- at the end of the weekend, you can exchange your tokens into different tier prizes
- the contents of the prizes will be randomly selected

for example,
- tier 1 may have 5 diamonds, some golems, a boss egg
- tier 2 may have a minor boss drop (ie not prim pearl or nether star), a spawner, a node
- tier 3 may have prim pearl, nether star, ichor, warp removal
you spend your tokens on each tier and are given a random item out of it
the token to tier ratio might change depending on how many games we run
like if we only run 6 games then tokens' value changes

subject to change, check discord for updates
